    <h1>What is your interest in IT?</h1>
<p>Programing- I started to like the idea of programming. I have never done programming before, but at my work, we have a programmer and like the idea of making things work by programming.
Mobile app – I want to know how to program a mobile app, maybe the board game I’m working on.
Machine learning – I would love to know how to do this and this might be a future project to learn.</p>

<h1>When did your interest in IT start?</h1>
<p>I had always loved IT, but I would go to my friend’s’s house to Dos computers and  cricket game most afternoons when I was a kid. So when I got my first job, I started buying and building a computer.
With my job, I see almost all equipment is interacting with IT, and for this reason, I want to get involved in IT.
When I start working with the  live production, I notice almost everything has to have some soft connection to the IT.
