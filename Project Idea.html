    <h1>Project Idea</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>  Animated home with Raspberry pi. Integrating with touch panel and video system. </p>
  <p>  I am having the whole home controlled by a mobile phone application and a touch panel.</p>
    <p>Using smart home appliances that run off Home assistant </p>
  <p>  It will have voice control on almost all the equipment. </p>


    <h3>Motivation</h3>

    <p>More people are staying home now and wanting everything to be at their fingertips.</p>
    So having an app that can control all the home appliances in one app or touch screen.
    This will make more appealing to this generation. This way I can assist people to optimize their
    time and save money on eletrecity as they will be able to control everything on the phone even when
    they are outside of the house.  </p>


    <h3>Description</h3>

    <h4>Home animation:</h4>
    I am using a Raspberry Pi to control all home appliances such as  Lights, Garage door, and Television  by
     using the Home Assistant app or the Touch screen in the house.

    <p>Garage door:</P>
    <p>As the normal function of opening and closing the door automatically, the app would have the feature of
    controlling this from anywhere. If you are at work and someone is in your place, you will able to open the door for them. The special sensor will allow you to relax on your way out by closing the door automatically.</p>

    <p>Lights: they can be turned off or on by your app on mobile or touch screen. The motion sensor will turn on the lights when you are walking into a room and turn off once you leave the room.  The motion sensor also could be set up to switch off the light when no motion is detected in that room,  saving you on your power bill. In addition, the lights can change colors to set the mood of the room. Also added voice command for the lights.
    Each room of the house can be named how you want it to be. E.g., bedroom 1 to kids room. The lights can be grouped if there is more than one light in a room. e.g, the Living room has three lights. You would group them to control all of the light in the Living room area at once. Then, you can dim the light to your preferred brightness.
    Controlling the light couldn’t be any more accessible by using a voice command or using the app on your smartphone.</p>
    <p>Air Condition:</p>
    <p> Able to turn on or off your Air Condition anytime you want from anywhere. , making your home comfortable when you arrive  by using the app on your phone is an amazing feature that can change people’s life. Be able to arrive home with all the appliances ready to serve you and be able to control everything in your house when you are away is a great way safe money and never be worrie that you left something on for a long time.  </p>
    <p>TV:</p>
    <p>On your app and touch panel, you can control the TV with voice commands or choosing on the app or touch. It will allow you to change the channel, change the TV source, and change the volume up or down. In addition, Xbox or Play Station can be turned on with your turn gets turn on. </p>


    <p>Touch panel:</p>
    <p> The touch panel works like the phone app but it only has one job to control and the decision in your home. The touch panel includes the Home screen with all the Icon Eg a Button for the Lights, Garage, Aircon, TV. Xbox, PS4. Each button has another page depending on what you choose. </p>

    <p>Voice Control:</p>
    <p> Voice control is only by google at the moment will change in the future update.
    Voice by saying, “Hey Google turn on the bedroom light.” There a lot of voice control you can use. </p>
    <p>Cameras:</p>
    <p> Able to see the cameras anywhere in the world. Get notifications on your phone when the camera sees movement. </p>

    <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
    <p>Raspberry PI:</p>
    <p> A small-sized computer was built for the educational purpose of teaching adults and kids how to program languages like Scratch and Python. Now the raspberry is used to play games on it to create smart homes.
    Software- Home Assistant is open-source software that will control most smart home devices. It uses Python code. It provides all devices to be managed in one spot.  </p>
    <p>Smart Lights:</p>
    <p> the smart lights can be dimmed or turn on and off by your smartphone. suppose you don’t already have them. </p>
    <p>AMX NX1200:</p>
    <p> is many uses to control AV using multiple analog and digital formats. For example, it will control the television to turn off and on, change channels, and turn off and on the Xbox.
    Camera: help to see what happens with your house while away. Maybe to watch your dog inside or front door. </p>

    <h4>Skills Required</h4>

    <p>Home Assistant- is an easy program, and there is an online video and a whole website on how to set up.
    AMX Netlink studio- a little knowledge of using the Netlink studio program and basic C+ programming skills. </p>

    <h4>Outcome<h4>
      <p> If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?
    An application would control the whole house on the phone or the touch panel, making it easier for the user and saving the user money. Maybe be a lazy way to switch off the light, but this makes it more accessible. The whole is going digital on everything, which means that our homes will go that way.  </p>
