    <h1>Personal Profile</h1>

  <p>  “If anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it is the Entertainer personality type. Entertainers get caught up in the excitement of the moment, and want everyone else to feel that way, too. No other personality type is as generous with their time and energy as Entertainers when it comes to encouraging others, and no other personality type does it with such irresistible style.”</p>

<h3>Learning Test</h3>
<h4>Tactile/Kinesthetic</h4>

<p>“Tactile/Kinesthetic learners learn best when they can use their sense of touch and can move about. If you are a tactile/kinesthetic learner, the suggestions that follow can help you succeed in school to the best of your ability”.</p>
<p>•	“Be physically active while you study. For example, rather than sit at your desk, occasionally walk back and forth with your textbook or notes as you read the information out loud.”</p>
<p>•	“To decrease your fidgeting as you study, listen to music, preferably baroque music. However, discontinue this if you find the music to be distracting.”</p>
<p>•	“Make extensive use of a computer and the Internet. Actively touching the keyboard will keep your mind active.”</p>

<h3 style="text-align: centre;">Big 5 Test</h3>
<h4"Openness to Experience – Low Characteristics</h4>

<p>“You are low in openness to experience. People who are low in openness to experience are typically very dedicated to any work they do, and always make sure to see their tasks through to the end. You are not very artistic or imaginative, and do not see the value in unnecessary things like art and music.
You are very analytical, and are able to think quickly to solve any problem you are faced with. Your first instinct is to use tried-and-true methods when solving problems.
You tend to see things as black-and-white. You believe that people usually do not change, and people are either good or bad. You believe that someone’s personal traits and choices play a bigger role than luck or circumstance.
People who are low in openness to experience often are well-suited for careers that allow them to have daily routines, with job duties that are very clear. For example, you may be well-suited for a job in finance, mechanics, or technology”

<h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
<p>I find it interesting, but I can’t entirely agree with all the personality traits. For example, I wouldn’t break and dance or sing. I can’t sing, but I like seeing everyone having a great time and will try and make sure they do. Also, I am a Tactile/Kinesthetic learner, loves to touch things.
I didn’t particularly appreciate the Big 5 test and saying people with these traits don’t have creative skill. </p>

<h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
<p>I will do well in a team environment. I love working in a team, and you can see from the personality test I work well with people. If you look at the Big 5 test, it is saying I’m a black and white person if that the case could cause tension in the group, not able to see the other person of view

<h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h4>
<p>Making sure I’m listening to people and hearing their views. </p>
<p>It helps me understand how people learn, and they could behave. However, I believe It is only a guideline of how a person will act; not all points are valid only some.
