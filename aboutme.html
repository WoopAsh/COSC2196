<p>When I was around ten years old, my parent spilled up. Moving between them every year, wasn’t easy. I went to six different schools in Deception Bay QLD area that it where I spent most of my life.

School was always challenging on the academic side but loved being with friends and playing sports.
I always got awards for sporting achievement from athletics, soccer, NRL, ALF, and pretty much any sport.
I was happily passing my subjects. I always struggled with English from primary school to high school.. I never had the opportunity to study Science and  it was suggested that I had to study a unique English to get my grades up for year 10.
Unfortunately, my parents decided to pull me out of school on year eleven as they were going on a trip for 3 months.
I studied Certificate IV in Mental Health, Diploma in Youth Work, Diploma in leadership, and theology.

Work in the Audio and video industry for eight years now. When I first started, I worked as a Production Technician to prepare  live events. I would use a Sound mixing deck, Video mixers, and some time lights. I changed jobs, went into service Technician working, then moved in Audio Video Technician install AV Equipment.

I’ve been married for six years. I have no kids, only a fur baby (dog).
I love playing sports, and I play two squash games a week. This is a way to had fun and keep my health and fitness well balanced with working life.
I love playing board games and video games, mainly sport games.
I’m currently working on a board game with a friend. We have been working on this project for the last 4 years , a Prolonged process.
